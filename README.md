# Quickly remove junk dns records from an onamae.com domain you've transferred to Cloudflare.
Useful python script to use the Cloudflare API to delete all the dns records from a newly purchased onamae.com domain. 

Add a Cloudflare API token and the zone ID from the domain you'd like to clean. Then run and voila!

It includes a confirmation so you don't do something you regret :)
